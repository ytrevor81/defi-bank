# defi-bank
A decentralized bank on Rinkeby, where you can deposit ETH and withdraw your ETH + interest

The "interest" users collect once they withdraw their ETH is an ERC-20 token named Trev Bank Currency (TBC).

If you have a Rinkeby account connected to your MetaMask wallet, check out my DeFi app here: https://ytrevor84.github.io/decentralized-bank-live/
